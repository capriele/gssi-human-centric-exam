  <description>"I accept having assistive robots checking my health
  status and supporting me, however, when I show signals of distress,
  the robot should put me in contact with my daughter by making a
  video call; if she does not answer the robot should ask the
  intervention of a nurse and leave my room if I will be in my room of
  move away from me."</description>
