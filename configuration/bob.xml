  <description>"If I will refuse the medications or to take pills, it
  is fine that the robot insists a few times. However, after a few
  attempts it should call the nurse. I accept that the robot uses
  cameras and microphones, however all my data cannot be distributed
  to third parties. Moreover, the robot can only store and/or
  distribute to the nurse videos and audios that are strictly
  necessary for my health, and in any case videos cannot be recorded
  in the toilet."</description>
