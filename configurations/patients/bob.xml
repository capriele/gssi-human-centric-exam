  <description>If I will refuse the medications or to take pills, it
    is fine that the robot insists a few times. However, after a few
    attempts it should call the nurse. I accept that the robot uses
    cameras and microphones, however all my data cannot be distributed
    to third parties. Moreover, the robot can only store and/or
    distribute to the nurse videos and audios that are strictly
    necessary for my health, and in any case videos cannot be recorded
    in the toilet.</description>
